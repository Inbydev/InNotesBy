## About the project

InNotesBy is a website primarily built with PHP that allows users to create public notes. With InNotesBy, you can creat notes with titles, author, and content. The content section provides a interface with buttons for Markdown formatting, and soon, real Markdown support will be integrated soon.

You can create notes with H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 headings, bold, italics, strikethrough, code blocks, links and upload an image with format PNG, JPG, or WebP. InNotesBy automatically converts uploaded images to WebP format with 20% of image compression ***(just if its enabled the gd php extension in php.ini or php configuration)***. Images exceeding 1080p resolution are automatically downscaled to 1080p ***(just if its enabled the gd php extension in php.ini or php configuration)***. Images larger than 8MB ignored during the upload process. Moreover, you can share a note by right-clicking on it and selecting **'Share'** or in the same note with the button with icon of **'Share'** at the top bar. Additionally, you can filter through the notes with the search input.

## About the project

InNotesBy is a website primarily built with PHP that allows users to create public notes. With InNotesBy, you can creat notes with titles, author, and content. The content section provides a interface with buttons for Markdown formatting, and soon, real Markdown support will be integrated.

You can create notes with H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 headings, bold, italics, strikethrough, code blocks, and upload an image with format PNG, JPG, or WebP. InNotesBy automatically converts uploaded images to WebP format with 20% of image compression ***(just if its enabled the gd php extension in php.ini or php configuration)***. Images exceeding 1080p resolution are automatically downscaled to 1080p ***(just if its enabled the gd php extension in php.ini or php configuration)***. Images larger than 8MB ignored during the upload process. Moreover, you can share a note by right-clicking on it and selecting **'Share'.** Additionally, you can filter through your notes with the search input.

Check the features of the future by checking out the 'Projects' section on this GitHub repository.

## New features added
- Preview Mode: allows you to see how your content will appear once it's published. By clicking it, you can view your written content with Markdown formatting.
- New Design: improved intuitiveness and user-friendliness, easier to navigate and utilize.
